These archeological remaining parts uncover proof of occupation from as soon as the second century BC. The stone cut Elephanta Caves were built about the mid-fifth to sixth hundreds of years AD. The most significant among the caverns is the incomparable Cave 1, which estimates 39 meters from the front access to the back. In plan, this cavern in the western slope intently looks like Dumar Lena cave at Ellora, in India. The principal body of the cavern, barring the porches on the three open sides and the back passageway, is 27 meters square and is upheld by lines of six sections each.
